# DyerShell: The Universal Wrapper that Ends Cloud Complexity

**Built by Matthew Dyer, Founder & Developer of Dyer-Tech.**

The era of proprietary complexity and vendor lock-in is over. **DyerShell** is the universal drop-in wrapper that provides **instant security provenance and compliance attestation** across any stack—Cloud, Edge, or Local.

| Feature | Value to Developer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Drop-In** | One single wrapper works for AWS, Azure, GCP, or bare metal. Stop writing bespoke glue code. |
| **IP Provenance** | **Guaranteed Founder Watermark & Attestation** baked into every artifact. Undeniable proof of governance. |
| **Compliance Signal** | Basic attestation endpoints (free tier) for simplified compliance reporting. |
