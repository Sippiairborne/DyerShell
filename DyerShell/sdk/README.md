# DyerShell SDK: Universal Integration
This directory contains SDKs and libraries for popular languages (Go, Python, Rust) to integrate DyerShell into application stacks.

## Key Functions:
- \init_dyershell()\: Initializes the wrapper and attestation process.
- \seal_artifact()\: Applies the visible and hidden founder watermark to the final binary/image.
- \get_attest_endpoint()\: Returns the current compliance signal status.

**Note:** The Go and Python directories are already scaffolded for rapid implementation.
