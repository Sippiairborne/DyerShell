# DYERSHELL UNIVERSAL WRAPPER (Self-Hosted by DyerLingo)

## ðŸ‘‘ 100% PROPRIETARY IP OF MATTHEW DYER, FOUNDER OF DYER-TECH (MEMPHIS, TN)

This repository serves as the definitive proof of **DyerLingo's** foundational capability: the **DyerShell Universal Wrapper** is coded entirely in the DyerLingo language. DyerShell is the execution layer that orchestrates secure, low-level OS commands across all platforms.

### ðŸ›‘ PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE NOTICE & USAGE RESTRICTION

**This repository contains IP and trade secrets. Any duplication, commercial use, modification, or reverse engineering of the concepts, architecture, or structure shown here is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

* **SELF-HOSTING PROOF POINT:** The native execution wrapper, \dyershell_wrapper.ps1\, is the compiled output of the DyerLingo source file, \manifests/dyershell_source.dyer\. This proves the self-hosting, foundational utility of the DyerLingo Compiler Core.
* **INFRINGEMENT:** Any attempt to implement the core orchestration logic shown in the \.dyer\ manifest or to replicate the \DyerGuardKernel\ functionality constitutes a direct infringement of Dyer-Tech's non-negotiable intellectual property.

### I. The DyerGuard Security Kernel: Non-Negotiable Core

DyerShell's ability to safely execute privileged commands is contingent on the **DyerGuard Security Kernel**.

* **IP Boundary:** The \untime/dyerguard_kernel_stub.rs\ file physically marks the closed-source **Rust** IP boundary.
* **Mandate:** DyerShell requires the \dyerguard_attested\ constraint to ensure every command is provably secure. **You cannot run DyerShell securely without acquiring the proprietary kernel.**

### II. Acquisition Mandate (Exclusive Terms)

All inquiries regarding licensing or acquisition of the **DyerLingo Compiler** and **DyerGuard Security Kernel** must comply with the following non-negotiable terms set by Matthew Dyer:

1. **Vetted Commercial Engagement:** All serious parties must submit a formal Letter of Intent (LOI) detailing a competitive acquisition offer to initiate exclusive, non-refundable commercial engagement with Dyer-Tech.
2. **Formal Intent:** The submission must detail a competitive acquisition offer.

**Contact Matthew Dyer (Founder, 100% IP Owner, Dyer-Tech, Memphis, TN)** to initiate the acquisition process immediately.
