.SYNOPSIS
    DyerShell - Universal Wrapper (Compiled by Proprietary DyerLingo Core).
.DESCRIPTION
    This is the compiled native execution wrapper for DyerShell. 
    Its source code is written in DyerLingo (see manifests/dyershell_source.dyer), 
    proving the platform's self-hosting capability.
    
    This script simulates the powerful, attested orchestration of the proprietary 
    DyerLingo Compiler Core.
.NOTES
    Â© 2025 Matthew Dyer, Founder and Developer of Dyer-Tech (Memphis, TN). All rights reserved.
    The DyerLingo Compiler Core and DyerGuard Kernel are required for full operation.
